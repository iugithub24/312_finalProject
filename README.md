- Preprocessor: I used less as my styling processor. This allowed me to use the built-in features such as creating variables for colors
as well as using the 'lighten' function. I also utilized the nesting feature to keep all my styling professional and allow for the same
reference names to be used.

- Responsiveness: Since I was using BootStrap, most of the responsiveness was handled by the built-in classes. I used rows and columns
to structure my content. As the screen size shrunk, media queries were used to rescale objects and maintain the 4 quadrant look.

- Hamburger Menu: For the navbar, I used BootStrap classes and features to set up the entire object. All the spacing, responsiveness,
and mobile functionality were automatically done by the BootStrap code. It also repositioned the links similar to a normal HTML/CSS
navbar.

- Favicon: I went to a favicon generator site and created this favicon of a computer. Since this project was related to Computer
Information Technology, I thought that this icon would be most appropriate. Of course, I styled it myself to make sure it followed
the Purdue color scheme.

- BootStrap Features: As I mentioned before, I used a BootStrap layout for the navbar so I could implement the hamburger menu
with ease. Then I decided to show the four quadrants as BootStrap cards. Since they already have a solid layout in regards to
images and text. Additionally, I added models for each concentration that provided more information regarding that field. To
display various careers, I chose to use accordions. This would allow me to create a dropdown effect and display different
information about each occupation. Finally, for the quiz page, I utilized BootStrap button classes to create the questions.
This way, the user can click to view the button and then proceed to check their answer. 

- Accessibility: As for accessibility, I made sure to utilize tags such as nav and footer. Furthermore, for the modals,
accordions, and some buttons, I used aria content to make sure that my page would be accessible to those using screen readers.
